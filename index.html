							<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
							<h3>Yes, please do spend some time on your headlines</h3>
							<p>Readers are attracted by the promise of being titillated, shocked, or horrified. They’re even crazier about receiving, in a four-minute read, life-changing knowledge they otherwise would have forever missed out on.</p>
							<p>
							A simple shark analogy will make this clear.</p>
							<p>
							A headline is like the dorsal fin of a shark. Seeing the fin and only imagining the shark makes our brains uncomfortable, a dissonance also known as an information gap.<sup>1</sup> We want to see the shark. We need to see the shark!</p>
							<p>
							Even if the shark is, well, not really a shark at all, but a 12-year-old kid with a snorkel, a rubber fin, and a questionable sense of humor.</p>
							<p>
							Actually, when it comes to enjoyment, they’re one and the same to our brains. The pleasure isn’t the payoff, but the anticipation of the payoff.<sup>2</sup></p>
							<p>
							Am I suggesting that baiting your titles to give your readers an instant dopamine rush without any real content is the right way to build a mailing list? I’m not.</p>
							<p>
							If your headline “Simon Cowell was eaten by pigs?” fails to deliver the feast, or any mention of Cowell or pigs, you’re eventually going to join the legion outfits like Showbiz Cheatsheet in Dante’s 10th circle of web hell: blogs blocked for all of eternity by conscientious readers.</p>
							<p>
							But.</p>
							<p>
							Titles are your stories’ dorsal fins (and a rapid information filing system for Google). Taking the time to find the right phrasing, spin, and content for your audience is the key, if not to getting read, then certainly to getting found.</p>
							<div class="notes">

							<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
							<h3>Reel us in with a story</h3>
							<p>Turning your web content into a narrative is a highly effective way of engaging your audience from the get-go because <a href="https://medium.com/storyline-creatives/if-storytelling-had-rules-they-would-look-like-this-a3acf5697bb3" target="_blank">story structure is naturally engaging</a>.</p>
							<p>
							To see this technique in action, check out Amy Davidson’s intro to her blog post on Michelle Obama for The New Yorker,<sup>3</sup> where instead of giving us background, opinion or argument, she drops us right into one of Obama’s speeches.</p>
							<p>
							English prof turned cage fighter Jonathan Gottschall also uses story­telling technique in his Salon article “My Own Personal Fight Club: How an English Professor Became a Cage Fighter,”<sup>4</sup> which is actually an excerpted chapter from his book, so it’s cheating a little.</p>
							<p>
							This is one of my favorite examples because we enter the story at the climax, so tension is already high. On top of that, we have a problem to solve: what’s going to happen inside that cage? It’s a fight, and no one can turn away from a fight.</p>
							<p>
							Make that two problems. Because we’ve also got to figure how on earth Gottschall, a professor, ended up in a cage about to have his face smashed in.</p>
							<p>
							Or take a look at my breakdown of <a href="https://medium.com/storyline-creatives/how-to-write-hooks-readers-cant-resist-7c6bb1d9c791" target="_blank">Richard Shapiro’s masterful intro</a> to his strange and tragic feature on St. James Davis, the U.S. chimp advocate who lost most of his face in a chimp attack.</p>
							<p>
							If you look closely, each of these examples uses the same technique to reel us in. They throw us into the middle of things from sentence one, injecting us headfirst into their stories. This way, they don’t have to tell us anything. We see, smell, hear, and feel it all, as the action unfolds.</p>
							<p>
							Does it have to be a first person account? No, but when you’re the narrator, you have a special advantage.</p>
							<p>As we’ll see below, when you tell stories based on your personal experiences, you give readers something they crave even more than a good cage fight: authenticity and vulnerability. Readers simply love listening to anyone who’s lived a life-changing experience and survived to tell the tale.</p>

								<h4>[3]&#32;“‘The reason why I said yes was because I am tired of being afraid,’ Michelle Obama told a crowd in Council Bluffs, Iowa, during the State Fair, in August of 2007, explaining why she had signed on to a long-shot campaign to elect her husband, Barack Obama, President of the United States. She stood in a middle-school gym, surrounded by a mostly white audience that was only beginning to know her husband and had an even vaguer idea of who she was. The stage was a small, low platform, but Obama, dressed in black pants and T-shirt, with her hair pulled back in a bun, occupied it like a dancer, punctuating her seven-minute address with appealing turns and pauses, as her listeners responded.”<p>

								[4] “It’s the night of March 31, 2012, and I am standing half naked in a chain-link cage. I’m bouncing restlessly from foot to bare foot, trying to vent the tension building at my core. I’m surrounded by a swarm of men in Tapout T-shirts who are hooting at me over cups of beer. I can see the young man coming through the crowd to break my face, to strangle me to sleep. It’s like a nightmare.I’m thirty-nine years old. I’m an English teacher at a small liberal arts college. My first book, “The Rape of Troy,” focused on the science of violence—from murder to genocidal war—but I learned all I know from an armchair. I’ve never experienced real violence, never even been in a fight. But that’s about to change.”

							<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
							<h3>Break up your text</h3>
							<p>We don’t like big flat endless Texan horizons on the web. We like what a mouse would see chasing a piece of cheese to the end of a plate.</p>
							<p>
							So no eight-sentence paragraphs, please. Our Twitterfied brains won’t go for it. If it can be broken up, break it.</p>
							<p>
							Isolate rhetorical questions with line breaks. Orphan final “ands” of lists. Widow “buts.” This is called sentence variation, which naturally creates small-scale text chunks, and emphasis.</p>
							<p>
							Font styles can also break up information very effectively — especially for static web copy, where readers have been trained to expect less and less.</p> 
							<p>
							If you’ve got more to say than you feel our eyeballs will stick around for, try putting your lead sentences into a smaller heading (h3 or h4) along with an accent color. This will give the illusion of less body text. Combine that with a bigger, bolder heading and you’ll also be adding hierarchy to your copy.</p>
							<p>
							Graphics, pull quotes, and even horizontal dividing lines, can also give respite and direction to copy-tired eyes.</p>
						</section>
						<section id="chapter-4">
							<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
							<h3>Abide the arc</h3>
							<p>Reading online isn’t like reading a novel, where we can take a break and pick up the story again. When our patience runs out on the web, we click away, and rarely ever go back to finish</p>
							<p>
							Writing stories with an arc (build-up, payoff, resolution) is a protective layer between your writing and the dreaded click.</p>
							<p>
							How it does that is also a storyteller’s most valuable weapon: <b>delayed gratification</b>.</p>
							<p>
							Which works, very generally, like this.</p>
							<p>
							A typical story — even a micro story like this section — engages us only for as long as it keeps our brains busy.</p>
							<p>
							Busy waiting for a character to work their way out of a problem.</p>
							<p>
							Busy waiting for the payoff promised in the headline or section of an article.</p>
							<p>
							When they solve the puzzle, or get the info they want, brains lose interest. When brains lose interest, fingers click.</p>
							<p>
							Delaying gratification, or plotting a story so that it unfolds in pace with a reader’s ability to solve it, is the only way we can fend off that event.</p>
							<p>
							In this case, you were specifically waiting to find out why story arc helps sustain interest.</p>
							<p>
							I’ve already told you: because it keeps our brains busy looking for solutions and answers.</p>
							<p>
							The reveal didn’t come in the second paragraph (because you’d have had no reason to keep reading), and it didn’t come in the last paragraph (because I’d have had no room for reflection or summing up).</p>
							<p>
							It came, like the punchline to any joke that’s ever made you laugh, right when it was supposed to come.</p>
							<p>
							Some of you, and not necessarily the TikTok disaster connoisseurs among you, might be wondering: why am I still reading then?</p>
							<p>
							That I can’t answer.</p>

							<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
							<h3>Make it personal</h3>
							<p>In a former life, when I was still trying to figure out how to make a living writing, I opened up a community creative writing space.</p>
							<p>
							I ran into a big stumbling block almost right out the gate: some writers, my target audience, felt that writing couldn’t be taught.</p>
							<p>
							As the director of the center, I was in an awkward position. I had to respond to those criticisms, but I had to do it in a way that was respectful of the views they expressed.</p>
							<p>
							And whatever I wrote, it had to get read.</p>
							<p>
							In the end, I chose to write a blog post about my personal journey to opening up a writing center, which also happened to be my personal journey to accepting the view that short story writing could be taught.<sup>5</sup> (Yes, in the story, I was once one of the detractors, and there’s no better story than the journey of the reformed convert!)</p>
							<p>
							That post went viral in our community.</p>
							<p>
							It was personal, and people like reading about other people, especially if they’re in the process of transforming themselves — whether it’s Marie Kondo tidying up a hoarder’s apartment on Netflix, or Walter White, the oatmeal high school chemistry teacher, turning into Heisenberg, the ruthless meth kingpin of “Breaking Bad.”</p>
							<p>
							Or even, apparently, this: a creative writer who left his job to open a community writing center.</p>

							<h2>Chapter 6</h2>		
							<h3>Make a point and don’t wander</h3>					
							<p>As a writer, your number one priority is to engage your readers, whether you’re writing about high-protein meat substitutes or summing up Noam Chomsky’s views on radical Islam. If they can’t follow your story or you start rambling, you have zero chance of engaging them.</p> 
							<p>
							At times, that very black-and-white line may appear blurry to you, the writer (which is why editors come in very handy). To your readers’ brains, however, the line is never fuzzy. It’s the ever-beckoning edge of a bottomless pit their interest in your article tumbles off into whenever you lose the thread.</p> 
							<p>
							The moment you start to deviate from your course, into, say, a history of meat substitutes or a history of Noam Chomsky’s failed marriages, is the moment you begin to hemorrhage visitors.</p> 
							<p>
							And, believe me, you don’t need more help losing readers than you already have from nature, embedded reading habits, and a slew of other factors that make your job one of the most difficult on the web.</p> 
							<p>
							So, the most important thing after an alluring (but not click-baity) headline, an electric intro, and a well-paced story with a personal journey, is writing that gets from point A to point B without once losing its way.</p>

							<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
							<h3>Always speak to your audience</h3>
							<p>Are you Gym Mom, 30-something on-the-go fitness blogger and mother of two?</p>
							<p>
							Then don’t start writing about your COVID sourdough experiments, or about how Swami Ramdev Baba saved your marriage, as a side note to your air squatting routine, even if they’re both tangentially related to your mental or physical health.</p>
							<p>
							You might delve into a post on how to pack a healthy meal for fitness-conscious moms on the run or on yoga as a weekly alternative to the gym. That’s in the ballpark.</p>
							<p>
							But anything too far afield and you’re jeopardizing your relationship with your readers. Not because your writing isn’t engaging or vital, but because you’re ignoring your audience.</p>
							<p>
							And the relationship you cultivate with your audience is what should be driving everything you write. Your end of that relationship is playing the stable, fully formed emissary of your brand voice. That’s what readers expect to find weekly when they click to read your content. It’s your mission and your covenant </p>
							<p>
							Whenever you set out to write a piece or brainstorm for ideas, remind yourself of that.</p>

							<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
							<h3>Write clearly and informally</h3>
							<p>Fat paragraphs bursting with 24-carat sentences might have worked for Herman Melville in Moby Dick (a book I love), but they won’t cut it on the web.</p>
							<p>
							It’s not that we’ve been totally dumbed down. It’s just an evolutionary survival instinct we’ve developed in the last 20 or so years since Michael Goldhaber predicted that, when the information levees burst, attention would be the most precious commodity of the future.<sup>6</sup></p>
							<p>
							It’s this instinct that helps us cope with the insane flow of information on our radar daily courtesy of Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Google, Amazon, and Spotify.</p>
							<p>
							It’s also why effortlessly digestible writing stands a much better chance at getting read than sentences constructed like Venetian escape tunnels.</p>
							<p>
							So keep your sentences as short and punchy as possible. Overly precious writing will quickly get you bounced.</p>
							<p>
							This doesn’t mean style doesn’t count. Far from it. It just means that we, the readers, aren’t paying by the pound anymore. Be stylish, but succinct.</p>
							<p>
							In terms of register, web writing is ideally a conversation. You’re talking with people, not at them. This means that whatever you learned in 10th grade English about formal versus informal, colloquial versus written, forget it.</p>
							<p>
							Let down the pretense, and get right to the point. Even Shakespeare knew when to take his gloves off.</p>
							<div class="notes">
								<h4>[6] Goldhaber predicted the web economy back in 1997. Read about it in <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/12/es-attention/" target="_blank">Attention Shoppers!</a> in Wired Magazine (of course).</h4>

							<h3>Get visual</h3>
							<p>In the fast food restaurant industry, they call the hard, plastic chairs they install to dissuade loitering “15-minute chairs” because, well, try sitting on one for more than 15 minutes.</p>
							<p>
							Your web texts should do the opposite. They should give readers the equivalent of deep, puffy bucket chairs they can sink into with Brazilian cocktail music playing overhead. Sink into and forget the ills of the world — and all the other things on their to-do lists — for a few, hard-found minutes.</p>
							<p>
							One powerful way to persuade readers to visit longer is to situate them in pleasant reading environments.</p>
							<p>
							Because let’s face it. If no one wants to spend too much time on a back-breaking chair the color of your parents’ first kitchen floor, the same goes for an eyesore of a web page.</p>
							<p>
							If you’re writing your own blog, you have complete control, which is great. Don’t have an eye for design? No problem. Hire a web designer to design a template for you.</p>
							<p>
							If you’re delivering texts to clients, your say in design is limited to nil. But simply being aware of, and knowledgeable about, basic design principles, will make you more useful to any creative team.</p>
							<p>
							Plus, they’re your texts. Engagement is what you’re getting paid for. So if something is stifling user enjoyment, it’s definitely in your interests to point that out.</p>
							<p>

							<h3>Don’t overlink</h3>
							<p>Linking to trustworthy sources that add value to your writing is a good way to establish credibility and participate in the social sharing ecosystem. It may also improve your Google page ranking over time. With this caveat: outbound links lead readers away from your writing and back into the wilds of the web.</p>
							<p>
							While you may not have a choice when you’re starting out — because you literally don’t have enough published content to link to — the longer you publish, the less you should be tempting visitors off your website with external links.</p>
							<p> 
							Instead, when it’s time, focus on linking to your own content. This is really the best way to give readers you’ve already engaged more of what they came for. Here’s a <a href="https://medium.com/storyline-creatives/internal-links-why-the-finishing-touches-on-your-blog-posts-are-important-for-more-than-just-seo-f9d803194104" target="_blank">deep dive into internal linking best practices</a> if you want to see how it works.</p>

						<section id="bonus">
							<h2>Bonus!</h2>
							<h3>Reflect</h3>
							<p>Every story needs some kind of resolution, so always leave a little space at the end, if only to remind readers what it is they’ve read.</p>
							<p>
							Something like this.</p>
							<p>
							To write content that gets read to the end, make it a story with an arc.</p>
							<p>
							Stun us with your intros. Be personal when you can, because that’s transformative, and readers really like that.</p>
							<p>
							Write clearly, write conversationally, write to the point.</p>
							<p>
							Chunk your text.</p>
							<p>
							Situate your stories on pages ideally suited to be read with titles that don’t make us feel like we’ve been had. When you have the urge to link to another website, consider a footnote instead. You can always add the link there.</p>
							<p>
							But above all, remember, writing guidelines are only suggestions, most often compiled by working writers who are learning just like you. They’re meant as food for thought, not Mosaic law.</p>
							<p>
							The journey you set off on with your writing is always a personal one. You’ll do things the hard way, and take plenty of detours before you get to wherever you’re headed.</p>
							<p>
							This is fine, because it will give you new guidelines of your own to add to whatever guidelines you find.</p>
							<p>
